# How to switch from a small SD to a large SD in ECE/MAE 148. 
Using [Document 10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gy4CEKjqXZub0rz-YmxFOakj9O_ZjMmlUYe7NLdM4FY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6tb3hsfky5xf) from ECE/MAE 148 go to the "Backup of the uSD Card" section.

Be on a **linux** machine or VM that is **linux**.

Follow the instructions there which in summary is finding the sd using 
```$ sudo fdisk -l```
If you can connect both SD cards at the same time and locate them both: do that. If you can only have 1 at a time, copy it to an image and then copy that image to the new SD.
Use the following to copy paste your SD where ```if=pathToCopyFrom``` and ```of=PathToCopyTo```:

```$ sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb of=ucsd_robocar_image_25sep19.img status=progress```

This will take a while to copy.

If you copy to an img you can copy it onto the new SD or conversely use a tool such as __Balena Etcher__ which can be found on google to write the new one.

To expand you can use ```$ gparted``` (may require ```$ sudo gparted```) command which opens a UI which allows you to select your new drive and simply drag the size of the partition you wanted to be bigger and save it.

Overall to find your SDs, copy, and resize, the commands are:

```$ sudo fdisk -l```

```$ sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb of=ucsd_robocar_image_25sep19.img status=progress```

```$ sudo gparted```
